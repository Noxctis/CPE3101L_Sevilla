QUESTION 1:
Given the signal x(t) found in the PNG-file named q1.png, edit the C-function 
with the prototype 

	double x(double t)

found in signals.c so that it defines x(t) as a piecewise function. Note that 
your definition must make use of inclusive relational operators e.g. <= or >= 
where it applies.


QUESTION 2:
Using the signal x(t) from QUESTION 1, find the piecewise definition of 

	y(t) = x(2t+1)

Edit the C-function with the prototype

	double y(double t)

found in signals.c so that it defines the y(t) after the independent variable
manipulation of x(t).


QUESTION 3:
Using the signal y(t) from QUESTION 2, define y(t) using shifted and scaled 
step signals u(t) and tu(t). Edit the C-function with the prototype

	double z(double t)

for your definition. Note that the unit step signal u(t) has been provided in
signals.c. As a hint, the mathematical expression u(t+1) + tu(t-2)  would be
defined as u(t+1) + t*u(t-2).


QUESTION 4:
Find the running integral
	           _
	          /  t
	r(t)  =   |        x(T) dT
	         _/   - oo

where x(t) is the signal from QUESTION 1. Define r(t) as a piecewise function
by editing the C-function with the function prototype


	double r(double t)

found in signals.c.
