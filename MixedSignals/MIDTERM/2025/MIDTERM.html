<b>QUESTION 1:<br></b>
Given the signal x(t) <br>
<img src="./q1.png">
<br>
found in the PNG-file named q1.png, edit the C-function 
with the prototype

<br><br><code><pre>
	  double x(double t).
</pre></code><br>

found in signals.c so that it defines x(t) as a piecewise function. Note that 
your definition must make use of inclusive relational operators e.g. <= or >= 
where it applies.
</p>
</p>
<p>
<b>QUESTION 2:</b><br>
Using the signal x(t) from QUESTION 1, find the piecewise definition of 
<br><br><code><pre>
	y(t) = x(-t-2)
</pre></code><br><br>
Edit the C-function with the prototype
<br><br><code><pre>
	double y(double t)
</pre></code><br>
found in signals.c so that it defines the y(t) after the independent variable
manipulation of x(t).</p>
<p>
<b>QUESTION 3:</b><br>
Using the signal y(t) from QUESTION 2, define y(t) using shifted and scaled 
step signals u(t) and tu(t). Edit the C-function with the prototype

<br><br><code><pre>
	double z(double t)
</pre></code><br>

for your definition. Note that the unit step signal u(t) has been provided in
signals.c. As a hint, the mathematical expression u(t+1) + tu(t-2)  would be
defined as
<br><br><code><pre>
    u(t+1) + t*u(t-2).
</pre></code><br>
</p>
<p>
<b>QUESTION 4:</b><br>
Given the relationship
<br><br><code><pre>
	           _
	          /  t
	x(t)  =   |        r(T) dT
	         _/   - oo
</pre><br><br></code>
where x(t) is the signal from QUESTION 1. Define r(t) as a piecewise function
by editing the C-function with the function prototype
<br><br><code><pre>
	double r(double t)
</pre></code><br><br>
found in signals.c. Note that for infinity use the given identifier Inf.
